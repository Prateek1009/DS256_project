### Introduction 
This repository contains the pipeline for Transfer Patterns Algorithm. Sweden's public transit network has been provided as a test case. The figure below shows the transit stop location.![plot](sweden.jpg)

The pipleline uses Spark Streaming Platform to model realtime environment.One-To-Many rTBTR algorithm has been used for preprocessing transfer patterns.
